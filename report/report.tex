This project will utilize the oandapy API to get realtime data from the currency market to analyse, as well as enter and exit trades on based on the analytics. In the analytics we are going to use a short and a long moving averages, furthermore we are going to use MCAD as an extra precaution before we enter trades and use recovery zones to prevent losses on the account
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Here will be written an introduction


\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Getting data}
We obtain all the financial data of the financial instrument EUR vs USD, on a 5 minute timeframe from oanda, using their own REST API for python. From oanda's API we get the financial charts of a 7 year time period, going from 2007-10-01 to 2014-10-20. After obtaining the data, it is stored in json fileformat in a file called "fxdata.txt", this data will then be used both to form our hypothosis of forex trading on the EUR vs USD currency pair, as well as performing a trading simulation on this set of data. However in order for us to use the naive Bayes classifier, we need to have two dataset's and not just a single one. In our domain the one dataset needs to be the trades which gained profit, and the other set needs consist of the trades which lost. We then have the possibility to analyze the data with different sets of features.\\
\\
The pseudo code of the random trading algorithm, where we will keep the orders for no more than 20 minutes:

\begin{center}
\begin{algorithmic}
\While{$streamFinancialData$}
	\State {$i = random(0,10)$}
	\If {$i = 0$}
    	\State {$openOrder(short)$}
	\ElsIf{$i = 1$}
    	\State $openOrder(long)$	    
	\EndIf
	\For{$order\: in\: orders$}	
		\If{$order.hasProfit()$}
			\State{$profitList.append(order)$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\ElsIf{$order.hasLoss()$}
			\State{$lossList.append(order)$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\ElsIf{$order.duration >= 4$}
			\State{$order.close()$}
		\Else
			\State{$order.duration += 1$}
		\EndIf
	\EndFor
\EndWhile
\State{$saveListToFile(profitList,"profit.txt")$}
\State{$saveListToFile(lossList,"loss.txt")$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{center}

This algorithm should theoretically give us equally profitable trades in both the long and the short direction.

\subsection{Specific features}
To analyse the data we use a supervised classification learning algorithm, or to be more specific we use a naive Bayes classifier, the idea is to use a naive Bayes classifier on our financial data we gathered using our random algorithm. This isn't a new concept, in fact there are a couple of scientific articles on this already, as can be seen in the article by KAWABATA and TAKATA \cite{fxNaiveBayes}. We will train the classifier on some specific features, however we will only use 2-3 features per training round. The training will be made in two rounds and the features are the following
\begin{itemize}
	\item{CrossGraph(SMA(10,40))}
	\item{RSI(period=100)}
	\item{openBid(period=1)}
	\item{closeBid(period=1)}
	\item{volume(period=1)}
	\item{spread(period=1)}
	%\item{Parabolic SAR default settings (0.02, 0.2)}
	%\item{MACD default settings (fast=12, slow = 15, period=9)}
\end{itemize}

The first round of features, is using some of the most common technical indicators on the FX market, this should give a good indication if those are just famous for being simple or if you actually are able to earn profit using these indicators. The second round another of the more simple techniques that some of the professional FX traders should use according to chat on the different trading forums, this isn't really a technical indicator, it is much more a way to look at the market and only make a trade if the current price reaches a specific value. Our hypothosis is that the traders who use price actions looks only at the price, so that is exactly what we are going to do as well, and by giving the classifier the features of openBid, closeBid, volume, and spread we hope to achive the behaviour of a price action trader. On the third and last round of features, we searched the internet for a forex trading strategy on the EUR vs USD pair, to see how our strategies of the first two rounds of features compare to a random strategy you can find on the internet. The strategy we found consist of using SAR indicator as well as three different MACD indicators.

\section{Design}
Before we start trading, we need to train our classifier based on the feature set we mentioned in the analysis. After the training is completed, we can then start trading based on our historical data. 
After a completed run of the historical data, the result of the trade is then shown on a graph, showing the profit/loss of a 5 minute interval. Figure 1. is showing a flowchart of how the trading cycles. From this we know that we need a driver to run the program, that retrieves signals from either the Random trader or the classifier, depending on what is chosen. The driver then creates orders of trades, but to keep track of them all, we need an order manager. The driver also needs to be able to withdraw/deposit money to an account manager. Figure 2. is showing the class diagram on how we will implement it all.\\

\section{Implementation}
Here we explain about the program itself

\section{Test \& Results}
\subsection{Test}
Our control test are made by running the program on the data.txt(roughly 23 days), with a leverage at 20, an account on 10000\$, and set the confidence level of the classifier at 96\%. When the program have gone though data, we retrieve the profit/loss. Hereafter we deviate one variable from the control, firstly we change the leverage to 400, then we change the confidence level of the classifier to 85\%.\\
We also want to check different datasets, the largest dataset goes from 2007 to 2014(, roughly 2557 days), then we use a data set that is newer than the control, going from 2014/11/10 - 2014/12/03(roughly 24 days) and the last data we go through is roughly a single day, the 2014/12/03, with a 5 second interval.\\
\\
We also test the random trader to see how effective it is, on both the control data and the large data FOOTNOTE The result may differ because the trade is random.\\
\\
We have generated graphs for each test, that shows the profit/loss on each interval, and the exchange rate for EUR/USD on each interval. FOOTNOTE See appendix for all graphs

Now that we have several test data, with the profit and by knowing how many days each data spanned over, we calculate the daily profit/loss for each test.
